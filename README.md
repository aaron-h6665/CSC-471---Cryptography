# Phase One of Comp Sci 471: Cryptography

## We explored the One-Time-Pad Encryption/Decryption Method.

This repository contains the code and extra work that I have submitted for Phase One of my Computer Science Class of Cryptography. 

* Created a file that emulates the One-Time-Pad Encryption/Decryption Method.
* Wrote a document that documents how a One-Time-Pad works.

## How to tweak this project for your own uses

Feel free to take this code and test/improve the homemade DES, Diffie-Hellmann Key Exchange, and RSA for yourself.
